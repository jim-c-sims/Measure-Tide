# Measure and save data for Tide, temp, barometric pressure, and humidity.
Use ESP32 conected to waterproof sonic distance sensor to measure heigth of tide. 
Communicate Data to ESP32 in office.
Record data to an sd card.
Will need RTC to time stamp data.
Would like to show graph of last 3 or 4 settings to show that tide is rising or falling.
